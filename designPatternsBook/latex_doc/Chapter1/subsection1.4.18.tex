  {sort(list)}
  {void sort ( ); 
  template <class Compare> 
    void sort ( Compare comp );}
  {\texttt{comp} – the binary predicate used to compare pairs of elements in order to ensure a proper sort order. 
  It takes arguments of the same type as the elements of the list.}
  {None}
  {This method performs the sorting of elements in a lexicographic order – from lowest to highest.

  The first version uses the operator < to compare pairs of elements. This operator is available for 
  built-in types. In order to use this function with other types, you must either create the operator for 
  those types, or create a binary predicate which will perform basically the same role. In that case, 
  the second variant of \texttt{sort()} must be used. This predicate must perform strict weak ordering. 
  During the sort, there’s no deletion, creation, or copying of elements within the list. The objects are 
  moved only.}

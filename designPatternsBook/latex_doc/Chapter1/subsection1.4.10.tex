  {This method swaps the entire content between two collections of the same type 
  (\texttt{list <–> list, vector <–> vector, deque <–> deque}). Although the types of 
  collections must be \textbf{the same}, their \textbf{sizes may differ}. After the change, 
  all the existing iterators are still valid, but they of course point to different containers. 
  After the swap operations, the calling container will be made up of elements from 
  the source collection, and vice versa.}

  {\texttt{binary\_pred} – binary predicate – a two-argument function or proper functional object, 
  which performs a comparison between two elements of the list in order to decide whether 
  they are alike or not. If they are found to be alike, the second element is removed.}
  {None}
  {The function \texttt{unique()} removes consecutive duplicates from the list. Basically, 
  the function makes a comparison between every two directly subsequent elements (starting from 
  the beginning of the list) and if they’re found to be alike, the second element is deleted. 
  The second version of this function does exactly the same thing, but it uses a binary predicate to 
  decide whether the objects are equal or not.

  For every element eligible for deletion, its constructor  is called, and the size of the list is 
  reduced. To supply the predicate to the method, you must use either the function pointer, or 
  the functional object instance.}

  {vector<T>::capacity}

  {None}
  {The total amount of space for elements currently allocated to a particular vector}
  {This method is present in the vector class only.

  The \texttt{vector} class has two methods related to its size. The first one is \texttt{size}, 
  which you already know. The second one is capacity.

  \texttt{capacity} is the total number of slots inside a vector which are currently allocated. 
  Some of the slots might be used; some of them might be free.

  \texttt{capacity} is always greater than or equal to \texttt{size}. As we said earlier, 
  the \texttt{vector} occupies a \textbf{contiguous memory area}. This approach has some limitations. 
  When a new element is inserted into a \texttt{vector}, its size is increased and the whole structure needs 
  to be reallocated. In practice, such an approach isnâ€™t very effective. In order to limit the number 
  of reallocations, the vector is equipped with a capacity capability.

  Each time a new element is put into the \texttt{vector}, it  first checks to see if there is enough capacity. 
  If not, the vector is reallocated, but the new capacity is usually larger than the old capacity + 1. 
  So, the next insertion/addition of an element will not require any reallocation of the vector. 
  This approach improves the performance of the vector.}

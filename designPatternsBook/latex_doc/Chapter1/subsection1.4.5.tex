  {A reference to the first element in a container}
  {this method returns a reference to the first element in a container. The reference might be normal or 
  constant: it all depends on the calling context.
  The purpose of this method is to retrieve the first value from the container. Because the element is 
  returned by a reference, it’s possible to modify it – a call to \texttt{front} can become the target of the 
  assignment – the \texttt{l-value}. The returned element is not removed from the container.}

  {A reference to the last element in a container}
  {this method returns a reference to the \textbf{last element} in a container. The reference might be normal or 
  constant – it all depends on the calling context.
  The purpose of this method is to retrieve the last value from the container. Because the element is 
  returned by a reference, it’s possible to modify it – a call to \texttt{back} can become the target of the

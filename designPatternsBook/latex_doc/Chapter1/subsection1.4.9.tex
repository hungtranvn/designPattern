  {erase}
  {iterator erase ( iterator position ); 
  iterator erase ( iterator first, iterator last );}
  {\texttt{position} – the iterator pointing to the element to be erased

  \texttt{first, last} – the iterators which specify the range of elements to be erased. 
  As usual, the range includes first and excludes last.}
  {An iterator to the first element after the last removed element, or \texttt{end} if the operation removes 
  the last element in the collection.}
  {This function removes an element or a range of elements from a collection. It’s important to note 
  that it uses iterators, and not the index value, nor the value of the element itself. After the 
  operation, the size of the collection is decreased. During the removal of the elements, 
  the destructors are called.}
